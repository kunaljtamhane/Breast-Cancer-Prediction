# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
**Overview**
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying breast cancer data using various classification algorithms. The dataset used in this project is a breast cancer dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

**Project Structure**
data.csv: The dataset used for classification.
notebook.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
requirements.txt: List of required packages for the project.
Data Description
The dataset includes various features related to breast cancer measurements, such as radius, texture, and area. The target variable indicates whether the cancer is malignant or benign.

**Installation**
To run the code in this repository, you'll need to install the required packages. You can do this using pip.

Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or install the packages individually:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy seaborn scikit-learn matplotlib xgboost imbalanced-learn
Usage
Load the Data:

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and inspected. The file data.csv should be placed in the project directory.

**Data Preprocessing:**

The notebook includes steps for data cleaning, normalization, and feature scaling.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Visualizations are created to understand the data distribution and relationships between features.

**Model Training and Evaluation:**

Various machine learning models are trained, including:

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Random Forest
XGBoost
Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV.

**Handling Imbalanced Data:**

SMOTE is used to balance the dataset, and models are retrained on the balanced data.

**Feature Selection:**

Important features are identified and used to train models, optimizing performance.

**To run the notebook, use the following command:**

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
Results
The project includes evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report for each model. Visualizations and performance comparisons are provided in the notebook.

Future Work
Additional Models: Explore more models and ensemble methods.
Advanced Feature Engineering: Implement more sophisticated feature engineering techniques.
Hyperparameter Optimization: Utilize advanced optimization techniques for hyperparameter tuning.
